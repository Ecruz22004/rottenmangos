			text: 'Many languages include a trill in their pronunciation, the sound of a consonant spoken while the tongue vibrates in a very specific way against the teeth or roof of the mouth. To pronounce this sound is also to trill. The word originally referred to a vibrating or warbling sound made by a singer, from the Italian word trillio, "a quavering or warbling," and its also often used to describe the sound a bird makes.'

			key: 'c',
			title: 'chinwag',
			subtitle: 'a long and pleasant conversation between friends',
			text: 'The journalist, who seems oddly unalarmed by the frequent reports of murders, loves a good chin-wag and keeps trying to chum up to Tshembe, who wants none of him.'
